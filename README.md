# instant coffee

instant coffee is a Python program that seamlessly integrates two popular services - Instagram and Telegram. It aims to tackle the common problem of keeping track of the latest posts from multiple Instagram accounts, which can be challenging, especially when the Instagram feed is not cake anymore. Without a reliable method to track new entries, it is easy to miss out on important posts, especially those that may have limited availability.

Instant Coffee offers a solution to this problem by monitoring selected Instagram account followees and detecting their latest posts. Once a new post is detected, the program forwards it to a dedicated Telegram bot. This provides an efficient and streamlined solution for you to stay updated on the latest posts from their favourite Instagram accounts.

To enable this functionality, instant coffee leverages the Instagram and Telegram APIs, enabling it to access and analyze the latest posts from selected account and send notifications to a dedicated Telegram bot. This ensures that you can stay on top of the latest posts and never miss out on critical updates, sales, or whatever is imporant to you.
